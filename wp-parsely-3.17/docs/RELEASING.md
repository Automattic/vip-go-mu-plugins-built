# Releasing

To release a new version of the plugin, a GitHub issue with the name of the release (for instance, _Release wp-parsely 3.12.0_) has to be created using the _Release_ template.

After creating the issue, the relevant steps laid down in that template must be completed. Every time a step is completed, please mark it using the checkbox. Once the relevant steps are done, the issue can be closed.

For the specific release steps, please consult the [Release template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release-template.md).
