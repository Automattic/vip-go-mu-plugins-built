This file contains a list of items that need testing for each release.  Please update it with every pull request. Make sure to follow the same format.
==============================
=== 3.7 ===

== New Features/Enhancements ==
* New admin page UI!
You'll notice that the main Jetpack admin page has changed.
To test: Please follow these instructions https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/2549, and anything else you can think of.

* Staging Site Support!
Clone your site's database to a new site, e.g. using a host's staging site feature. Previously, since both databases had the needed info to communicate to WordPress.com's record for the original site, there would be lots of things broken/weird. Now, when opening on a site where WP.com and your site's siteurl/homeurl settings differ, we'll prompt you to ask what's going on.
To test: A brand new site cloned from an existing one: Confirm that the "Reset Connection" option properly connects the new site (e.g. the stats aren't shared with another site) and the original site remains operational.
To test: On a staging site, any changes made (e.g. creating new posts) are not reflected on the WP.com record. Example way to check: Visit the wordpress.com My Sites for the original test site and confirm any posts made only on the staging site aren't listed as a post there.

* Subscriptions per-post opt out!
When using the Subscriptions module, you can now opt-out individual posts from being sent out to subscribers.
To test: Toggle the checkmark in the publish meta box on an unpublished post.

* Switched notifications to API v1.1
To test: Make sure that new notification overlay is properly displayed both in the admin area and in the front-end area.

* Reddit "Official" Sharing Button
To test: Confirm that, when using the official Reddit button, the Reddit posting page opens in a new window/tab, not the original.

* Publicize Custom Message: Previously, once a custom Publicize message was set, it could not be completely removed.
To test: Set a custom message when writing a new post, save a draft, then come back and remove the message to restore the default settings.

* Open Graph tags with smart punctuation
To test: Set the post title or description (e.g. excerpt) to use smart punctuationâ€”curly quotes, angled apostophes, etc, and confirm sharing on various services that use OG tags works as expected (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc).

* New VideoPress player
Updates the Jetpack VideoPress player to HTML 5 when using the [wpvideo] shortcode and registers VideoPress as an oEmbed provider.
To test: Add an VideoPress permalink into the editor to test oEmbed.
To test: Play videos via oEmbed and the wpvideo shortcode on a number of browser/OS combinations.

* PollDaddy shortcode
The PollDaddy shortcode had been updated and enhanced quite a bit on WP.com. 3.7 brings those enhancements downstream.
To test: Add a PD poll via the Shortcode. Confirm it loads and no JS errors (JS changed to async)
To test: Add a PD poll via oEmbed (dropping in the poll.fm link). New to Jetpack.
To test: Add a PD poll via Shortcode on a HTTPS site. Expected: Works with no mixed content issues.

* Widget Visibilty Enhancement!
A new rule has been added to show/hide widgets based on Parent Page. Very helpful for all of your hierarchical page-based site needs!
To test: Set widget visiblity option for a parent page, confirm works as expected on a child of that page.

* bbPress Love!
Previously, Jetpack didn't insert Sharing buttons on bbPress CPTs even if they were set to be used via Settings->Sharing
To test: Enable Sharing on bbPress CPTs and confirm they're added.

== Fixes ==
* No longer forcing http:// on API urls
To test: If you have a site that uses HTTPS, please test to ensure that social sharing, shortlinks, and managing your site through WordPress.com all work as expected

* Edit Posts List Table: Fixed the styling associated with the Likes column resulting from 4.3 changes.
To test: Confirm no visual oddities while on either WP 4.2.x or 4.3.x

* Facebook Embeds: In some cases, the script loaded early resulting in no embed
To test: Try embedding a FB post using the Facebook shortcode.

* Sharing/Likes: Front Page settings
To test: Set a page as your site's front page and confirm the "Front Page" sharing option is respected.

* Open Graph Tags
DailyMotion videos are treated the same as YouTube/Vimeo. If the logic suggets a video screencap should be used, it'll now include DailyMotion.
