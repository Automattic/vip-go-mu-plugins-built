/**
 * Incrementally processes the strict multipart/mixed format used by Reprint.
 *
 * The processor is independent of the transport which supplies its bytes. A
 * cURL response callback can append each received fragment, while an HTTP
 * endpoint can append bounded reads from php://input. In both cases the caller
 * drains tokens synchronously before appending another fragment:
 *
 *     $multipart->append_bytes($bytes);
 *     while ($multipart->next_token()) {
 *         if ($multipart->get_token_type() === Site_Export_Multipart_Processor::TOKEN_BODY) {
 *             fwrite($output, $multipart->get_current_body_piece());
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * A part produces one PART_START token, zero or more BODY tokens, and one
 * PART_END token. PART_START exposes the complete normalized header map. BODY
 * exposes at most MAX_INPUT_FRAGMENT_BYTES and remains current only until
 * next_token() is called again. PART_END means every byte declared by
 * Content-Length was supplied; the following call validates the CRLF and next
 * boundary before it can expose another part.
 *
 * Reprint deliberately uses a narrower grammar than general Internet MIME.
 * Every part requires a decimal Content-Length, all syntax uses CRLF, header
 * names are unique, and the request or response begins with its first boundary
 * and ends with its closing boundary. Reprint has emitted this form since its
 * first multipart exporter. Requiring a length makes arbitrary file bytes
 * unambiguous: the processor never searches a binary body for a delimiter and
 * can distinguish truncation from a clean close.
 *
 * next_token() returns false both when more bytes are required and after the
 * closing boundary. paused_at_incomplete_input() and is_complete() distinguish
 * those states. Once the transport reaches EOF, finish_input() verifies that a
 * complete closing boundary was seen; incomplete syntax or body data throws.
 * The processor retains only one bounded input fragment, one bounded header
 * block, and one current body token. It never accumulates a complete part.
