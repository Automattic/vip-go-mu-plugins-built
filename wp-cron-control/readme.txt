This plugin allows you to take control over the execution of cron jobs.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to take control over the execution of cron jobs. It's mainly useful for sites that either don't get enough comments to ensure a frequent execution of wp-cron or for sites where the execution of cron via regular methods can cause race conditions resulting in multiple execution of wp-cron at the same time. It can also help when you run into posts that missed their schedule.

This plugin implements a secret parameter and ensures that cron jobs are only executed when this parameter is existing.

== Installation ==

* Install either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
* Activate the Plugin and ensure that you enable the feature in the plugins' settings screen
* Follow the instructions on the plugins' settings screen in order to set up a cron job that either calls `php wp-cron-control.php http://blog.address secret_string` or `wget -q "http://blog.address/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron&secret_string"`
* If you like to have a global secret string you can define it in your wp-config.php by adding `define( 'WP_CRON_CONTROL_SECRET', my_secret_string' );`

== Limitations ==

This plugin performs a `remove_action( 'sanitize_comment_cookies', 'wp_cron' );` call in order to disable the spawning of new cron processes via the regular WordPress method. If `wp_cron` is hooked in an other action or called directly this might cause trouble.
