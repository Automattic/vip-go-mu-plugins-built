Grant of License.</b> Getty Images grants to you, for a period of thirty (30) days, a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable and non-assignable right to use the image and/or film preview file you have selected and any derivatives or copies (collectively, the "Licensed Material"), on your personal computer and, in the case of film, in any test, sample, comp or rough cut evaluation materials.

Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the Licensed Material may not be shared or copied for example by including it in a disc library, image storage jukebox, network configuration or other similar arrangement. Use which would be defamatory, pornographic or otherwise unlawful is prohibited. If Licensed Material featuring a person is used (i) in a manner that implies endorsement, use of or a connection to a product or service by that model; or (ii) in connection with a potentially unflattering or controversial subject, you must print a statement that indicates that the person is a model and is used for illustrative purposes only.</td></tr></tbody></table><br><table cellpadding="4px" border="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" class="SmStan"><b>3. Rights-Managed Still Fee.</b>  For rights-managed still Licensed Material only, if at the end of 30 days you have not licensed the Licensed Material for end use in a final project, you will be invoiced a comp service fee in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150) USD or such other local currency amount as Getty Images may apply from time to time. If, at any time within the 30-day comp license period, you license such rights-managed still Licensed Material for end use in a final project and do not subsequently cancel the license, the comp service fee will not be charged. Payment of the comp service fee relates solely to comping use during the 30-day comp license period and does not entitle you to make any additional use of the Licensed Material either before or after expiry of the 30 days.</td></tr></tbody></table><br><table cellpadding="4px" border="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" class="SmStan"><b>4.
