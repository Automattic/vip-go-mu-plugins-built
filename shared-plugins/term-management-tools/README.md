Allows you to merge terms, set term parents in bulk, and swap term taxonomies.

## Description 

If you need to reorganize your tags and categories, this plugin will make it easier for you. It adds two new options to the Bulk Actions dropdown on term management pages:

* Merge - combine two or more terms into one
* Set parent - set the parent for one or more terms (for hierarchical taxonomies)
* Change taxonomy - convert terms from one taxonomy to another

It works with tags, categories and [custom taxonomies](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies).

### Usage 

1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Posts -> Categories`.
2. Find the Bulk Actions dropdown.
3. Reorganize away.
