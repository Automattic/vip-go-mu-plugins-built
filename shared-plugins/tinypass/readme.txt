Tinypass is the best way to charge for access to content on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Tinypass is a simple, powerful plugin that allows any online publisher to easily sell access to any type of content, whether it's a blog post, a site subscription, a digital download, or even a pay-per-view video. Tinypass can accept payments as small as **2 cents ($0.02)**, supports **24 currencies**, and doesn't require changing your site's existing structure or layout. We make it easy to charge for content! 

Any site, large or small, can use Tinypass to easily build a new revenue stream from paid content. And while you're still free to earn money from advertising anywhere on your site, we've seen that a simple paid content plan can quickly surpass what you can earn from advertising, even if you're only selling access to a small percentage of your site's content. And since it doesn't cost anything to get started with Tinypass, we make it easy to experiment with charging for content.  

Selling content is **easy** with Tinypass. Just create a free publisher account at Tinypass.com, download our plugin, then decide what content you want to charge for. In minutes you can use our simple tagging method to build a subscription plan, bundles of content.

And for your visitors, buying access to content through Tinypass couldn't be easier. We offer a **wide choice of payment methods**, we don't require your visitors to create an account before making a purchase, and all transactions happen in a quick, secure environment. Gone are the days of clunky shopping carts and confusing checkouts!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Tinypass? =

Tinypass is a flexible, powerful, enterprise-grade tool for selling access to any kind of digital content. We enable publishers and content creators to charge in any amount, on their own sites, with pricing rules that they control.

= So it's like a paywall? = 

We don't love the term "paywall", because it implies a binary either-you-pay-or-you're-locked-out paradigm, and Tinypass enables much more sophisticated pricing models, but it is a common industry term. So if a paywall is what you're looking for, we have lots of satisfied publishers who use Tinypass for exactly that! 

= How do I use Tinypass? =

You can deploy Tinypass in one of two ways: either you can use one of our existing plug-ins for popular CMS platforms (Wordpress and Drupal are currently available, with more on the way), or you can use our API to integrate Tinypass into another existing system. Currently we offer libraries for Java, .NET, and PHP.

The Tinypass plugin was designed to sell content in a way that makes sense for WordPress, and there's no need to work with any of the code if you don't want to.
