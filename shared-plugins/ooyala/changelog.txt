Changelog:


Tested:
3.0 - 3.1.2
2.9: Working but with Visual flaws.
I'd recommend setting the minimum version in the repository to 3.0

A complete rewrite:
- Use a media screen instead of a tinmyce button, make popup look more like WP's own media screens
- convert shortcode to shortcode API, removing unused options (shortcode will still work for old style syntax).
- Use global content_width if no width is set in ooyala options screen
- Localize the Javascript
- Either put all functions in a class, or prefixed to prevent function names clashes. (Both JS and PHP)
- Switch OoyalaBacklotAPI to use WP's HTTP class

Recommendations:
 - Tighten up the visual styles, add visual "loading" animations where necessary.
 - Improve the Upload screen (I couldn't get past the 100% to the "done" phase.).
