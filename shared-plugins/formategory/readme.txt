Formats posts based on their category.

== Description ==

Formategory allows you to customize posts based on their categories. Just define a template for a category, and all of the posts in that category will be displayed according to the template.

Use the buttons in the top-right meta box to insert placeholders for the post's content; {{ the_content }} will be replaced by the post's content, and {{ the_title }} will be replaced by the post's title. Select some categories for the template, and after you save it, any posts in those categories will be instantly templated.

The "Category Templates" page in your dashboard allows you to manage your templates just like you manage your posts and pages.
