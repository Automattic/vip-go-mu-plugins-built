Simply shows the ID of Posts, Pages, Media, Links, Categories, Tags and Users in the admin tables for easy access.

== Description ==

Simply shows the ID of Posts, Pages, Media, Links, Categories, Tags and Users in the admin tables for easy access. Very lightweight.

A common complaint about the edit posts, pages, media, links, categories, tags and users pages is that there is no easy way to see the ID of the specific item. This plugin will add a new column titled 'ID' that will display each items ID.

IDs for categories, tags and users will only display when using WordPress 2.8 or newer.

This plugin is very simplistic and thus very lightweight. To facilitate the need of a lightweight alternative to other plugins of its type this plugin was created.

Props to [Joel Fisher](http://flushinc.com/) for getting me moving on this plugin.
