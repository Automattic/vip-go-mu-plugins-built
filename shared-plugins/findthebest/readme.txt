Add relevant, interactive visuals to any WordPress post.

== Description ==

Add relevant, interactive content to any WordPress post. Our plugin turns plain
text into visually engaging articles, with images, slideshows, side-by-side
comparisons, and deep details on people, organizations, products, and services.

To begin, click the "Add Visuals" button above the post editor. If your post
contains any content, we'll begin searching for visuals that match what you're
writing about. From this interface you can also search for something specific,
see trending visuals, or browse by category. You can start a search from our
search box in the WordPress sidebar.

Once you've found the visual you want to use and customized it to your liking,
click "Add" button to insert this visual into your post. The content will
appear as a gray placeholder within your article. To see the content in action,
simply preview or publish your post.

The plugin includes over 1,500 topics (ex: Presidents), 500 million entities
(ex: Barack Obama), and billions of points of information (ex: Obama's
historical approval ratings compared to other presidents).
