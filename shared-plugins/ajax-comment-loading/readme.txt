Loads comments with a secondary AJAX request, including comment paging. Speeds initial loading of the page.

== Description ==

When your posts get a lot of comments, performance can be a concern. The generation of the comment HTML and the delivery of all that HTML can slow down your page loads. **This plugin has pages load without comments, and then uses a secondary AJAX request to pull down the comments.** Navigating through the pages of comments is also handled via AJAX. On my test install with 100 comments per page, the `onload` event fires 2x faster. The HTML is generated by the server 6x faster. The HTML downloads 3x faster. The uncompressed size of the HTML is reduced by a factor of 17.

Initial development of this plugin was commissioned by Google — many thanks!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `ajax-comment-loading` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the "AJAX Comment Loading" plugin in your WordPress administration interface

3. View a page with more than X comments.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it work on my theme? =

Your theme may substantially deviate from standard WordPress comment section HTML layout. The plugin was developed against the Twenty Ten theme. Try another theme, or try standardizing your theme's HTML. I don't plan to add support for other markup — I'd rather that people work on standardizing their theme comment markup instead.

= Doesn't this prevent search engines from seeing comments? =

No, it doesn't! Through the magic of Google's "AJAX Crawling" specification, search engines (currently Googlebot and Bingbot) will be made aware that the page includes AJAX-fetched content, and will request your page with a special URL that will have this plugin skip AJAX-generation and instead give the full HTML to the crawler.
