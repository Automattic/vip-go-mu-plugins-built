== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the placeholder image =

`
add_filter( 'lazyload_images_placeholder_image', 'my_custom_lazyload_placeholder_image' );
function my_custom_lazyload_placeholder_image( $image ) {
	return 'http://url/to/image';
}
`

= How do I lazy load other images in my theme? =

You can use the lazyload_images_add_placeholders helper function:

`
if ( function_exists( 'lazyload_images_add_placeholders' ) )
	$content = lazyload_images_add_placeholders( $content );
`

Or, you can add an attribute called "data-lazy-src" with the source of the image URL and set the actual image URL to a transparent 1x1 pixel.

You can also use output buffering, though this isn't recommended:

`
if ( function_exists( 'lazyload_images_add_placeholders' ) )
	ob_start( 'lazyload_images_add_placeholders' );
`

This will lazy load <em>all</em> your images.
