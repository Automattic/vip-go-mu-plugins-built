== Description ==

Add **related posts**, related images and tags from your blog and half a million other blogs. You save time, increase your SEO, and become a member of our network of over 120,000 bloggers!

* **Related posts**: Get recommended related posts from your own blogs
* **Increasing your authority**: Increase your authority by linking to most authoritative related posts (good for SEO).
* **Related Images**: Use related images right from the sidebar. Proper credits are added by default.
* **Link Love**: Link to other bloggers' related posts that we recommend and in turn, we'll recommend your posts to other bloggers. Then find out how much love (links, tweets, likes) each of your posts received via Zemanta Dashboard.

After Zemanta analyzes your post, a simple point and click interface allows you to easily insert related posts, related images, links and tags. By not having to search for related posts, you will save time and increase the efficiency of your editorial process.
