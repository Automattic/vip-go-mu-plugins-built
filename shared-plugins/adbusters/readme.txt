A set of iframe busters for popular ad networks

== Description ==

Are you troubled by strange iframe ad files in the middle of the night? Do you experience feelings of dread in your revision control and source code management system? Have you or any of your colleagues ever had to manually add these files to your site as your ads team keeps making new deals?

If the answer is yes, don't wait another minute! ADBUSTERS! Download this plugin today and let us take care of your ad file serving needs.

Caveat: while we have reviewed the included templates for obvious security issues (like XSS), we cannot guarantee the reliability of external scripts referenced by most of the adbusters. We highly recommend discussing with your ad network representative to discuss this if you have any concerns.
