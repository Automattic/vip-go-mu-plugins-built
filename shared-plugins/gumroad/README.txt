Display your Gumroad products right on your Wordpress page.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you embed, https://gumroad.com/embed, or overlay, https://gumroad.com/overlay, your Gumroad purchase pages with little to no coding effort.

The Gumroad overlay lets you bring in the Gumroad purchase pages right onto your site, so that transactions can happen inline â€” in a pretty Gumroad lightbox:

The Gumroad embed lets you bring in Gumroad products right onto your site, so that transactions can happen inline (*Gumroad embed requires HTTPS to work!* [Here is a Wordpress plugin that assists in HTTPS setup](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/)):

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.

If the overlay doesn't get triggered on click (and your browser is redirected to a gumroad.com URL), please make sure that there is not extra code that is hijacking the click event (for example, a Google Analytics onclick event).

A popular known plugin that does this is "Google Analytics for WordPress". Try unchecking one or both of these options: 1) Track outbound clicks & downloads, 2) Check Advanced Settings, then make sure "Track outbound clicks as pageviews" is un-checked.

See the official Gumroad [overlay](https://gumroad.com/overlay) or [embed](https://gumroad.com/embed) documentation for further troubleshooting.
